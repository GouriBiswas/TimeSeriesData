# 📈 Time Series Data Analysis & COVID-19 Case Study  

This repository is dedicated to **Time Series Data Analysis**, including preprocessing, visualization, forecasting, and real-world case studies like **COVID-19 spread prediction**.

## 🚀 What is Time Series Analysis?  
Time series analysis is a statistical method used to analyze **data points collected over time**. It helps identify **trends, seasonality, and patterns** in data that evolves over time.

**Examples of Time Series Data:**  
✔ Stock prices 📉  
✔ Weather forecasts 🌦  
✔ Economic indicators 💰  
✔ COVID-19 cases 🦠  
✔ Sales and revenue trends 🏬

## 📊 Time Series Components  
A time series dataset can be broken into these key components:  

### **1️⃣ Trend**  
📈 **Long-term movement** in data (e.g., increasing global temperatures).  

### **2️⃣ Seasonality**  
🔄 **Repeating patterns** in data at fixed intervals (e.g., summer sales, flu season).  

### **3️⃣ Cyclic Patterns**  
♻️ **Irregular fluctuations** in data over time (e.g., business cycles).  

### **4️⃣ Noise**  
⚡ Random variations that cannot be explained by trends or seasonality.
